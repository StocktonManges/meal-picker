## About the Meal Picker App

This project introduces navigation between screens in a React Native app using the @react-navigation/native package along with the @react-navigation/drawer package. It nests multiple navigation techniques as well.

It also shows examples of how to use React props drilling, set dynamic styles, and abstract reusable elements into separate components.
